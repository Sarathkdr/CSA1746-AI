% Base case: The sum of integers from 1 to 1 is 1.
sum(1, 1).

% Recursive case: The sum of integers from 1 to N is N plus the sum of integers from 1 to N-1.
sum(N, Result) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    sum(N1, TempResult),
    Result is N + TempResult.

% Query to get the sum of integers from 1 to 10.
sum_of_1_to_10(Result) :-
    sum(10, Result).
